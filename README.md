<h1 align="center">Welcome, adventurer! 👋</h1>

<div align="left">
  <h3>How are you? Hopefully, everything is all right.</h3>
  <p>I presume that you are a little bit confused on how this works, but don't be afraid my dear friend, we are here to help you!
  If you have any doubtfulness, please, contact the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/RGP-Digital/teams/staff-team" target="_blank">Staff/Moderation Team</a> at our <a href="https://discord.gg/Gb3aETExuK" target="_blank">Discord Server</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>🖥️ I want to create a repository for a project on my mind, am I able to?</h3>
  <p>Yes, but we have restrictions and only the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/RGP-Digital/teams/staff-team" target="_blank">Staff/Moderation Team</a> are able to do that for you. You can require how you want it to be!
  <h3>Why's that?</h3>
  <p>When a new project is created, a team comes up with it as well so there's a better structure within the organization.</p>

<br>

  <h3>🖥️ A new repository has been created because of my request, how do I manage that?</h3>
  <p>There are some options:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use the default template repository that we provide for everyone
    </li>
    <li>
      Require a template already owned by you on your personal account or somewhere else
    </li>
    <li>
      Utilize your creativity and make a template of your own
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
<br>

  <h3>🖥️ Wow, that easy?</h3>
  <p>For sure, we want to provide the best experience for everyone. Talking about it, the same rules on our discord server are applied here, so do not forget about them.</p>
